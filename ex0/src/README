=============================
I implemented the class in a way that only the library has access to the other components of
the program. the library holds arrays of patron and books objects, and responsible to register them.

=============================
there is not so mach sophisticated concepts, the main principle which leading the writing is that
the methods should look neutral as possible while the runtime stat linear in the books and the patrons
capacity ( for example when suggesting book to some patron, the method extracting the maximal score value while
compering each book almost one time ).
