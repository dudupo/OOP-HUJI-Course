packages -
 operations-> include all the operations.
    factory -> responsible to create the operations.
    propertyopreations -> responsible for all the filters
                        which filter by existing of property.
    rangeoperators -> responsible for all the filters
                    which filter by comparing the size.
    sortoperations -> responsible for all the sorters.
    substringopreations -> responsible for all the filter
                        which filtering by some regx.

core files:
   Operation.java the ancestor of all the operations.
   Heap.java the sorting implementation.
   Parser.java the parser which iterate over command file and
            generate the operations.
   FileDelegate.java represents delegate to the file.
   Section.java represents a section object.

        handle errors :

            for handling errors while parsing some line, I have
            implements a mechanism which allowing more freedom degree,
            when calling to functions in the hierarchy tree.

                inputValidator -      * applying Validation actions, in top-dawn order.
                                      * which mean that, each of the sub classes, first
                                      * call to the super.inputValidator and only after
                                      * that, doing some self Validation.

                and in the opposite, order :

                inputValidatorReverse -      * applying Validation actions, in dawn-top order.
                                             * which mean that, each of the sub classes, first
                                             * doing some self Validation and only after that,
                                             * call to the super.inputValidatorReverse

            the combination of those, allow to calling to different methods in
            the hierarchy tree.

        Sorting :

            I have implements the heapsort algorithm, that because it's insure
            en upper bound of nlog(n) run time in the worst case, the a algorithm
            use a datastructre which called en heap. that structure is binary tree,
            which assume that the root of the tree is greater than all his childes,
            that invariant allow us to rooter or extract a node from the tree in log(n)
            times.
